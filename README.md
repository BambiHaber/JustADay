# justaday - The date picker that can provide you with.. just a day!

Well, this is horribly written and shouldnt be used anywhere ;) haha..
I was working on an Electron project and was looking to NOT add jQuery, and have a datepicker for user details - to pick their birthdate, and all I needed was just a day picker. 


## Getting Started

Right now this is a mess I should be putting everything in order..

### Running

Just add the js with a script tag, and the compiled _style.css file.

```
let birthdayPicker = new JustADay({el: document.querySelector('input.birthDate')})
```
